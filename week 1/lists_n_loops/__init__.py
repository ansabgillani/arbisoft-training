"""Python lists can be iterated through different means, which include but not limited to:

-> simple for loop
-> for loop with range
-> while loop
-> enumerate
-> list comprehension
Each of these methods does the same thing. But are there any performance differences with each of these methods? 

The purpose of this task is to:

-> Practice different loop iteration methods
-> Perform a time execution analysis for a list against all of these methods
-> Plot the results
-> Find out if one method is superior in terms of performance and why

Script requirements:

-> The list size should be variable, provided either via command-line argument or user input
-> Some operations should be performed on each element of the list. That operation can be mutable/immutable.
-> Don't print the items of the list during iteration. That can impact the execution time.
-> Use pep8 conventions when writing the code.
