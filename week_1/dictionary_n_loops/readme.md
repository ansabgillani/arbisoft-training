Python dictionaries, also known as Maps in other programming languages, is an important data structure. Just like lists, dictionaries provide different methods to iterate over the contents. These include but not limited to:

- Dict comprehension
- for loop with dict.items
- for loop with dict.keys

Task details:

- Analyze the execution time for different dict iteration methods
- Plot the chart for execution time
- Understand and document why one method might be faster than others.
